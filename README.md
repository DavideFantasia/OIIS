  Here you can find some of the problem I (and my team) solved.<br>
  Some of them, may not be the 100/100 points solution, but at the time, it was our best.<br>
</p>

ðŸš¨<b>this is not meant to be a way to cheat the practice test, just a way to share our solution and discuss them</b>ðŸš¨

### Feel Free to contact me to suggest any way to improve the code or just to discuss our different approach
